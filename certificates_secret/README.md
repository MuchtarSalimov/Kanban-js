# Certificates and kanban secrets

This folder is to contain kanban ssl certificates, and other secrets. 
Except for the present readme, no other files should be present in the repository. 

The present folder is added in the .gitignore to prevent you from accidentally adding your 
kanban's secrets to your development repository.
