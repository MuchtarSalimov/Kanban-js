## Node.js installation instructions


### Ubuntu 16.04
1. Intall nodejs. 
1.1. If for some reason you installed a wrong version of nodejs 
 - for example, you installed the default which 
is outdated at the time of writing this readme - then you may:
```
sudo apt remove nodejs
```

1.2. Do the installation as described at:
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
