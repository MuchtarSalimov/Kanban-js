\frametitle{Design goals for the Kanban protocol}
The slide(s) list some of the design goals considered; will be udpated.

\begin{enumerate}
\item KB's inherit authority from the foundation blockchain (POW).
\item \label{itemKanbanIsFunctionOfFoundationChain} Except state between blocks, Kanban network's state aims to be function of longest foundation chain. 
\item Data not directly in foundation chain: store error check (hash) in the found. chain. If no hash collisions, consistent with preceding.
\begin{itemize}
	\item EVM state can be used for storage.
	\item A heavy-weight storage engine (callable by EVM) could be designed to reduce EVM state.
\end{itemize}
\item Should Kanban networking be reverted (longest chain overtake), all transaction chains approved by Kanban that do not involve reverted coinbases/incentives should be recoverable.

\end{enumerate}
