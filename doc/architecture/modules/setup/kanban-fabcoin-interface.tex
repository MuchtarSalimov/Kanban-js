\frametitle{Kanban-Fabcoin interface}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each Kanban communicates with the fabcoin interface through a smart contract. 
	\item Contracts may be user-defined.
	\item It is assumed that there is one or more ``hard-coded'' (``reserved'') contracts, one of which is designated the ``default'' contract.
	\item The non-default ``hard-coded'' contracts may be used for older versions of the default.
	\item ``Hard-coded'' contracts can simply be contract addresses.
	\item Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed each KB node communicates with the ``default'' contract.
